# Outdoor Travel Website

This repository contains the code for an outdoor travel website that was developed in 2017. The website includes various features such as outdoor team management, activity planning, and a travalog function for users to share their travel experiences. Please note that the website was closed in 2019, and this repository serves as a showcase of my programming ability and previous web development experience.
